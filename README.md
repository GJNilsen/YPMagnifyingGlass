# YPMagnifyingGlass

YPMagnifyingGlass is Swift port of [ACMagnifyingGlass](https://github.com/acoomans/iOS-MagnifyingGlass), a magnifier like the one in the iOS _notes_ app.

## Usage

Select the view you want to magnify, and embed it in another view. Set the views class to `YPMagnifyingGlass`, and connect it to an `IBOutlet` property in your `UIViewController` (or whatever else).

## Installation

Add _YPMagnifyingGlass.swift_ and _YPMagnifyingView.swift_ to your project
